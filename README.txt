# DivArtBot

Welcome to DivArtBot! This is a work in progress, so expect updates and improvements along the way. The goal is to enable text generation models to create images by coloring divs in a grid-like canvas. It's a playful experiment where every div is a tiny pixel waiting to be part of a masterpiece.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have:
- **LM Studio** installed on your system.
- A decent **instruct model** loaded in LM Studio for generating responses and interacting with the application.

Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to contribute or share your thoughts!
